# daq-docker

This repo at the moment is linked to [dunedaq/sl7](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dunedaq/sl7) on dockerhub.

New commits to the `main` branch will trigger an automatic build of the image `dunedaq/sl7:latest`.

Creations of new release tag (e.g. `0.0` or version tag (e.g. `v0.0`) will also trigger automatic builds of images tagged as `dunedaq/sl7:release-x.x` or `dunedaq/sl7:version-x.x).
